# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver
 - I modeled Rubik's Cube as a linear programming model. 
 - The solution from running the model guarantees to find the minimum solution for any randomly scrambled cube.
 - This model runs on 2*2*2 cube for simplicity, but can be easily generalized on a higher level Rubik's Cube.
